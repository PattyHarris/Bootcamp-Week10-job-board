# Create a Job Board

This week's project is to create a job board that allows access to companies to post jobs as well as job seekers looking for jobs. Job seekers are allowed to apply for jobs, etc.

1. The initial setup is the same as for Week 9 - see the README.md file there for the manual setup steps. The completed project for reference is here: https://github.com/flaviocopes/bootcamp-2022-week-10-job-board
2. In addition, the NextAuth.js is setup as before. Note that the link for generating a secret is https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32
